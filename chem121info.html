	<h1>Chemical Materials, Strain </h1>
	<p>Metals are used in engineering designs for many reasons, but they generally
        serve as structural elements. Thus, we shall initially concentrate on the mechanical properties of metals in this chapter.
        METALS
        The mechanical properties discussed next are not exhaustive but instead are
        intended to cover the major factors in selecting a durable material for structural
        applications under a variety of service conditions. As we go through these various
        properties, an attempt will be made to use a consistent and comprehensive set of
        sample metals and alloys to demonstrate typical data and, especially, important
        data trends.
        
        170 CHAPTER 6 Mechanical Behavior
        Perhaps, the simplest questions that a design engineer can ask about a
        structural material are (1) “How strong is it?” and (2) “How much deformation
        must I expect given a certain load?” This basic description of the material is
        obtained by the tensile test. Figure 6.1 illustrates this simple pull test. The load
        necessary to produce a given elongation is monitored as the specimen is pulled in
        tension at a constant rate. A load-versus-elongation curve (Figure 6.2) is the
        immediate result of such a test. A more general statement about material characteristics is obtained by normalizing the data of Figure 6.2 for geometry. The
        resulting stress-versus-strain curve is given in Figure 6.3. Here, the engineering
        stress, s, is defined as
        s = P
        A0
        , (6.1)
        where P is the load on the sample with an original (zero-stress) cross-sectional
        area, A0. Sample cross-section refers to the region near the center of the specimen’s length. Specimens are machined such that the cross-sectional area in this
        region is uniform and smaller than at the ends gripped by the testing machine.
        This smallest area region, referred to as the gage length, experiences the largest stress concentration so that any significant deformation at higher stresses is
        localized there. The engineering strain, P, is defined as
        P = l - l0
        l0
        = ∆l
        l0
        , (6.2)
        where l is the gage length at a given load and l0 is the original (zero-stress)
        length. Figure 6.3 is divided into two distinct regions: (1) elastic deformation
        and (2) plastic deformation. Elastic deformation is temporary deformation. It is
        fully recovered when the load is removed. The elastic region of the stress—strain
        curve is the initial linear portion. Plastic deformation is permanent deformation.
        It is not recovered when the load is removed, although a small elastic component
        is recovered. The plastic region is the nonlinear portion generated once the total
        strain exceeds its elastic limit. It is often difficult to specify precisely the point

        SECTION 6.1 Stress Versus Strain 171
        at which the stress—strain curve deviates from linearity and enters the plastic
        region. The usual convention is to define as yield strength (Y.S.) the intersection of the deformation curve with a straight line parallel to the elastic portion
        and offset 0.2% on the strain axis (Figure 6.4). The yield strength represents the
        stress necessary to generate this small amount (0.2%) of permanent deformation. Figure 6.5 indicates the small amount of elastic recovery that occurs when a
        load well into the plastic region is released.
        Figure 6.6 summarizes the key mechanical properties obtained from the
        tensile test. The slope of the stress—strain curve in the elastic region is the
        modulus of elasticity, E, also known as Young’s* modulus. The linearity of the
        stress—strain plot in the elastic region is a graphical statement of Hooke’s† law:
        s = EP. (6.3)
        The modulus, E, is a highly practical piece of information. It represents the stiffness of the material (i.e., its resistance to elastic strain), which manifests itself
        as the amount of deformation in normal use below the yield strength and the
        springiness of the material during forming. As with E, the yield strength has
        major practical significance. It shows the resistance of the metal to permanent
        deformation and indicates the ease with which the metal can be formed by
        rolling and drawing operations.

        *Thomas Young (1773–1829), English physicist and physician, was the first to define the modulus of
        elasticity. Although this contribution made his name a famous one in solid mechanics, his most brilliant achievements were in optics. He was largely responsible for the acceptance of the wave theory
        of light.
        †
        Robert Hooke (1635–1703), English physicist, was one of the most brilliant scientists of the 17th
        century as well as one of its most cantankerous personalities. His quarrels with fellow scientists such
        as Sir Isaac Newton did not diminish his accomplishments, which included the elastic behavior law
        (Equation 6.3) and the coining of the word “cell” to describe the structural building blocks of biological systems that he discovered in optical-microscopy studies.
        
        172 CHAPTER 6 Mechanical Behavior
        Although we are concentrating on the behavior of metals under tensile loads,
        the testing apparatus illustrated in Figure 6.1 is routinely used in a reversed mode
        to produce a compressive test. The elastic modulus, in fact, tends to be the same for
        metal alloys tested in either tensile or compressive modes. Later, we will see that
        the elastic behavior under shear loads is also related to the tensile modulus.
        One should note that many design engineers, especially in the aerospace
        field, are more interested in strength-per-unit density than strength or density
        individually. (If two alloys each have adequate strength, the one with lower density is preferred for potential fuel savings.) The strength-per-unit density is generally termed specific strength, or strength-to-weight ratio, and is discussed relative
        to composite properties in Chapter 12. Another term of practical engineering
        importance is residual stress, defined as the stress remaining within a structural
        material after all applied loads are removed. This stress commonly occurs following various thermomechanical treatments such as welding and machining.
        As the plastic deformation represented in Figure 6.6 continues at stresses
        above the yield strength, the engineering stress continues to rise toward a maximum. This maximum stress is termed the ultimate tensile strength, or simply the
        tensile strength (T.S.). Within the region of the stress–strain curve between Y.S.
        and T.S., the phenomenon of increasing strength with increasing deformation is
        referred to as strain hardening. Strain hardening is an important factor in shaping metals by cold working (i.e., plastic deformation occurring well below onehalf times the absolute melting point). It might appear from Figure 6.6 that
        plastic deformation beyond T.S. softens the material because the engineering
        stress falls. Instead, this drop in stress is simply the result of the fact that engineering stress and strain are defined relative to original sample dimensions. At
        the ultimate tensile strength, the sample begins to neck down within the gage
        length (Figure 6.7). The true stress (str = P>Aactual) continues to rise to the point
        of fracture (see Figure 6.8). Because of the substantial deformation of the sample
        geometry beyond the ultimate tensile strength, that point along the stress–strain
        curve corresponding to the ultimate tensile strength is sometimes referred to as
        the onset of plastic instability.

        elastic recovery occurs after fracture); and 5, toughness = 1sdP (measured under load;
        hence, the dashed line is vertical).
        
        SECTION 6.1 Stress Versus Strain 173
        For many metals and alloys, the region of the true stress (sT) versus true
        strain (PT) curve between the onset of plastic deformation (corresponding to the
        yield stress in the engineering stress versus engineering strain curve) and the
        onset of necking (corresponding to the tensile stress in the engineering stress
        versus engineering strain curve) can be approximated by
        sT = KPn
        T, (6.4)
        where K and n are constants with values for a given metal or alloy depending on
        its thermomechanical history (e.g., degree of mechanical working or heat treatment). In other words, the true stress versus true strain curve in this region is nearly
        straight when plotted on logarithmic coordinates. The slope of the log–log plot is
        the parameter n, which is termed the strain-hardening exponent. For low-carbon
        steels used to form complex shapes, the value of n will normally be approximately
        0.22. Higher values, up to 0.26, indicate an improved ability to be deformed during
        the shaping process without excess thinning or fracture of the piece.
        The engineering stress at failure in Figure 6.6 is lower than T.S. and occasionally even lower than Y.S. Unfortunately, the complexity of the final stages of
        neck down causes the value of the failure stress to vary substantially from specimen to specimen. More useful is the strain at failure. Ductility is frequently quantified as the percent elongation at failure (= 100 * Pfailure). A less-used definition
        is the percent reduction in area [= (A0 - Afinal)>A0]. The values for ductility
        from the two different definitions are not, in general, equal. It should also be
        noted that the value of percent elongation at failure is a function of the gage
        length used. Tabulated values are frequently specified for a gage length of 2 in
        (= 50.8 mm). Ductility indicates the general ability of the metal to be plastically
        deformed. Practical implications of this ability include formability during

        fabrication and relief of locally high stresses at crack tips during structural loading (see the discussion of fracture toughness in Chapter 8).
        It is also useful to know whether an alloy is both strong and ductile. A
        high-strength alloy that is also highly brittle may be as unusable as a deformable
        alloy with unacceptably low strength. Figure 6.9 compares these two extremes
        with an alloy with both high strength and substantial ductility. The term
        toughness is used to describe this combination of properties. Figure 6.6 shows
        that this is conveniently defined as the total area under the stress–strain curve.
        Since integrated s - P data are not routinely available, we shall be required to
        monitor the relative magnitudes of strength (Y.S. and T.S.) and ductility (percent elongation at fracture).
        Values of four of the five basic tensile test parameters (defined in Figure 6.6)
        for various alloys are given in Table 6.1. Values of the strain-hardening parameters of Equation 6.4, K and n, are given in Table 6.2.
        The general appearance of the stress-versus-strain curve in Figure 6.3 is
        typical of a wide range of metal alloys. For certain alloys (especially low-carbon
        steels), the curve of Figure 6.10 is obtained. The obvious distinction for this latter
        case is a distinct break from the elastic region at a yield point, also termed an
        upper yield point. The distinctive ripple pattern following the yield point is associated with nonhomogeneous deformation that begins at a point of stress concentration (often near the specimen grips). A lower yield point is defined at the
        end of the ripple pattern and at the onset of general plastic deformation.
        Figure 6.11 illustrates another important feature of elastic deformation,
        namely, a contraction perpendicular to the extension caused by a tensile stress.
        This effect is characterized by the Poisson’s* ratio, v, where

        *Simeon-Denis Poisson (1781–1840), French mathematician, succeeded Fourier in a faculty position at
        the Ecole Polytechnique. Although he did not generate original results in the way Fourier had, Poisson
        was a master of applying a diligent mathematical treatment to the unresolved questions raised by others.
        He is best known for the Poisson distribution dealing with probability for large number systems.

        the relatively narrow band of 0.26 to 0.35.
        
        SECTION 6.1 Stress Versus Strain 177

        loading. The shear stress, t, is defined as
        t = Ps
        As
        , (6.6)
        where PS is the load on the sample and As is the area of the sample parallel
        (rather than perpendicular) to the applied load. The shear stress produces an
        angular displacement (a) with the shear strain, g, being defined as
        g = tan a, (6.7)
        which is equal to ∆y>z0 in Figure 6.12. The shear modulus, or modulus of rigidity,
        G, is defined (in a manner comparable to Equation 6.3) as
        G = t

        178 CHAPTER 6 Mechanical Behavior
        The shear modulus, G, and the elastic modulus, E, are related, for small
        strains, by Poisson’s ratio; namely,
        E = 2G(1 + n). (6.9)
        Typical values of G are given in Table 6.3. As the two moduli are related by v
        (Equation 6.9) and v falls within a narrow band, the ratio of G>E is relatively
        fixed for most alloys at about 0.4 (see Table 6.3).
        EXAMPLE 6.1
        From Figure 6.3, calculate E, Y.S., T.S., and percent elongation at failure for the
        aluminum 2024-T81 specimen.
        SOLUTION
        To obtain the modulus of elasticity, E, note that the strain at
        s = 300 MPa is 0.0043 (as shown in the following figure). Then,
        E = s
        P = 300 * 106
         Pa
        0.0043 = 70 GPa.
        The 0.2% offset construction gives
        Y.S. = 410 MPa.

        (MPa)
        The maximum for the stress–strain curve gives
        T.S. = 480 MPa.
        Finally, the strain at fracture is Pf = 0.08, giving
        , elongation at failure = 100 * Pf = 8,.
        
        SECTION 6.1 Stress Versus Strain 179
        EXAMPLE 6.2
        A 10-mm-diameter bar of 1040 carbon steel (see Table 6.1) is subjected to a
        tensile load of 50,000 N, taking it beyond its yield point. Calculate the elastic
        recovery that would occur upon removal of the tensile load.
        SOLUTION
        Using Equation 6.1 to calculate engineering stress gives
        s = P
        Ao
        = 50,000 N
        p(5 * 10-3
         m)2 = 637 * 106 N
        m2
        = 637 MPa,
        which is between the Y.S. (600 MPa) and the T.S. (750 MPa) for this alloy
        (Table 6.1).
        The elastic recovery can be calculated from Hooke’s law (Equation 6.3)
        using the elastic modulus of Table 6.1:
        P = s
        E
        = 637 * 106
         Pa
        200 * 109
         Pa
        = 3.18 * 10-3
        .
        EXAMPLE 6.3
        (a) A 10-mm-diameter rod of 3003-H14 aluminum alloy is subjected to a 6-kN
        tensile load. Calculate the resulting rod diameter.
        (b) Calculate the diameter if this rod is subjected to a 6-kN compressive load.
        SOLUTION
        (a) From Equation 6.1, the engineering stress is
        s = P
        A0
        = 6 * 103

        m2 = 76</p>
