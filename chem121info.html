2 Cellular level. Molecules combine to form cells, the basic structural and functional units of an organism that are com- posed of chemicals. Just as words are the smallest elements of language that make sense, cells are the smallest living units in the human body. Among the many kinds of cells in your body are muscle cells, nerve cells, and epithelial cells. Figure 1.1 shows a smooth muscle cell, one of the three types of muscle cells in the body. The cellular level of organization is the focus of Chapter 3. 3 Tissue level. Tissues are groups of cells and the materials surrounding them that work together to perform a particular function, similar to the way words are put together to form sentences. There are just four basic types of tissues in your body: epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue, and nervous tissue. Epithelial tissue covers body surfaces, lines hollow organs and cavities, and forms glands. Connective tissue connects, supports, and protects body organs while distributing blood vessels to other tissues. Muscular tissue contracts to make body parts move and generates heat. Nervous tissue carries information from one part of the body to another through nerve impulses. Chapter 4 describes the tissue level of organization in greater detail. Shown in Figure 1.1 is smooth muscle tissue, which consists of tightly packed smooth muscle cells.
4 Organ level. At the organ level, different types of tissues are joined together. Similar to the relationship between sentences and paragraphs, organs are structures that are composed of two or more different types of tissues; they have specific functions and usually have recognizable shapes. Examples of organs are the stomach, skin, bones, heart, liver, lungs, and brain. Figure 1.1 shows how several tissues make up the stomach. The stomach's
outer covering is a layer of epithelial tissue and connective tissue that reduces friction when the stomach moves and rubs against other organs. Underneath are three layers of a type of muscular tissue called smooth muscle tissue, which contracts to churn and mix food and then push it into the next digestive organ, the small intestine. The innermost lining is an epithelial tissue layer that produces fluid and chemicals responsible for digestion in the stomach.
6 System (organ-system) level. A system (or chapter, in our language analogy) consists of related organs (paragraphs) with a common function. An example of the system level, also called the organ-system level, is the digestive system, which breaks down and absorbs food. Its organs include the mouth, salivary glands, pharynx (throat), esophagus (food tube), stomach, small intestine, large intestine, liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Sometimes an organ is part of more than one system. The pancreas, for example, is part of both the digestive system and the hormone-producing endocrine system.
6 Organismal level. An organism (OR-ga-nizm), any living individual, can be compared to a book in our analogy. All the parts of the human body functioning together constitute the total organism.
In the chapters that follow, you will study the anatomy and phys- iology of the body systems. Table 1.2 lists the components and intro- duces the functions of these systems. You will also discover that all body systems influence one another. As you study each of the body systems in more detail, you will discover how they work together to
